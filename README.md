# Master Thesis Project

Code used for experiments in my Master Thesis project that was done in collaboration with NRK:

> Automatic Topic Generation for Broadcasters:
> Usable Metadata from Topic Models on
> Systematically Preprocessed TV Subtitles

`./textPrep` contains the textPrep library as adapted from [textPrep](https://github.com/GU-DataLab/topic-modeling-textPrep). Here, the library has been modified to work for the Norwegian dataset used in the Master Thesis project. The modified version (fork) of textPrep can be found [here](https://github.com/magnurr/topic-modeling-textPrep-Norwegian-subtitles)
